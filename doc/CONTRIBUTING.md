# WELCOME TO OUR CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES


For the repository owner, and contributors these guidelines are a way to communicate how people should contribute.

To help you save on time and hassle down the road,  these contribution guidelines will help for submitting well-formed pull requests and opening useful issues.

The following is laid out to help govern and champion a productive collaborative effort.

# ISSUES
The following resource may help you understand the process for submitting an Issue.
 * [HOW TO OPEN ISSUES VIDEO HELP & UNDERSTANDING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YshvUGgF_3o)

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. 

Adding a reaction can also help to be indicate to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter-

### ASSIGNING YOURSELF TO AN ISSUE
If you find an issue that you would like to begin working on, please make sure to assign yourself and declare that you have begun.
 

# PULL REQUESTS
## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE YOUR FIRST CODE (PR)

Make sure that you are following the criteria outlined below in these guidelines.

* Using the `Pull Request Template` will help to guide you in making useful and neat contributions.

### NAMING BRANCHES
For naming your new branches, it is good practice to consider naming the branch in your name or by the name of the problem being solved. Also link it with the number of the issue i.e. Jane/Nav-bar/12 
<yourName>/<featureName>/<issueNumber>
 
### NAMING THE PULL REQUEST
When deciding a title/name for your pull request please prefix with:

+ (Feat): For a new feature e.g. if I were creating a new Navbar the title would be (Feat): This is a new feature and the new feature is a Navbar, but the title should be something like '(Feat): Add a Navbar component'.
+ (Fix): I am fixing something.
+ (Doc): Some new documentation.
I.e. "fix.folder-structure" this outlines what you are doing and what you have done. It is short and sweet, to the point and informative. It will make documenting and revisiting code in the future easy to read and understand.
 
### APPROVALS BEFORE MERGING 
It is important to seek approvals of your Pull Requests before merging your work to the main branch. It is good practice to obtain approvals from 3 or more team members. These will avoid reopening PR.
 
### MERGES
Once you have an approved PR, your contribution can be merged to the main branch and you can continue to work on a new Issue, repeating the process.
